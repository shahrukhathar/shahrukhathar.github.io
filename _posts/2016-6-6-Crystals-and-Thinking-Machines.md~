Machine learning is used everywhere, it finds its application in a number of diverse fields ranging from targeted advertisements to disease diagnosis to Crystallography.  
So what is Machine Learning? And why is it so successful? In 1959, Machine Learning was defined by Arthur Samuel as the "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed". Simply put, machine learning algorithms give computers the ability to learn from data.
These algorithms take in data and try to figure out patterns within them, once a pattern is discovered it is then used for prediction when new data comes along. Let's study a simple situation where machine learning can be used. Suppose, we would like to figure a way out to predict the price of a house given its area. The only information we have is a bunch of prices of houses and their corresponding areas

| Area   | Price |
|------|-----|
| 1000  |18000 |
| 2200  | 23000|
| 2500  | 49500|
| 3100  | 51500|
| 4500  | 77500|
| 5200  |64000 |
| 6100  | 91500|
| 7400  |124000|

This data in itself does not tell us much, lets try to plot this data and see what we get

Looking at the plot one can, with reasonable certainty, conclude that the price depends linearly on the data, or in math speak it follows this form

\begin{equation}
    P = wA + t
\end{equation}

This line is what we call a regression line. Here \(P\) is the price, \(A\) is the area and \(w\) and \(t\) are two constants.  
But what is the exact dependence? What are the exact values of \(w\) and \(t\)? is the price twice the area? ten times the area? or 13.278 times the area? Before we try to answer those questions, we must have a way to measure how well the regression line describes the data. To do this we define an error function of the following form

\begin{equation}
    E = \sum_{i = 0}^{i = n}(P_{predicted}^{i} - P_{actual}^{i})^{2}
\end{equation}
